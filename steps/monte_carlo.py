## Modified By: Callam
## Project: Lotto Predictor
## Purpose of File: Perform Monte Carlo Simulations on Lottery Number Probabilities
## Description:
##    This file runs Monte Carlo simulations to generate a frequency distribution
##    for the 40 main lottery numbers. It adjusts number probabilities based on
##    decay factors and clustering information, ensuring more recent draws and
##    identified patterns have greater influence. The results are stored in the
##    pipeline for use in subsequent steps of the prediction process.

Changelog (Illustrative Numeric Adjustments):
- Added CLUSTER_MULTIPLIER to amplify cluster influences.
- Lowered MIN_PROBABILITY to 1e-8 for less aggressive clipping.
- Tweaked dynamic Monte Carlo simulation count with a multiplier for more robust estimation.
- Added optional random seed control for reproducibility.
- Vectorized the simulation loop to handle large mc_sims more efficiently.
